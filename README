I was woking with a grid. 
I used coding from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV8B24rSN5o&t=2s
I tweaked it to make it a little more stylized.
I have not finished it but I am still working on it. 

I actually ran into lots of problems using that coding and  some how mangaged to delete it all.

Now I am redoing this project for a 3rd time with a new design and tutorial I am using. 
Below is what I have been following
once completeed I fully intend to change some the elements, colors and fonts to more my personal style.

    Hi Everyone! my name is Jennifer, but I go by Jenn, Jenny, can you help me? and even hey you! 
    Ok so a little about me. According to my dentist I am 141 years old. (their typo not mine). 
    I have always had a passion for creating something from nothing. I have a BFA in Graphic Design. 
    I am a rare breed I'm a unicorn; meaning I have a  wide variety of jobs I have done and I am a 50/50 split or Graphic Designer and Office Manager. 
    <br>
    Not only do I enjoy design on the computer but I enjoy design and sculpting food. I also have apprenticed as a pastry chef, fostered and trained puppies (11 not all at the same time) and yes I adopted the first pup I fostered A year later we adopted another pup. I have animal sat all different pets, and for a few years, made designer silk scarves from start to finish. I just moved to CT almost a year ago. 
    I love anything art; painting, sculpting, photography, graphic design, web design...etc.  
    I enjoy mysteries and solving puzzles and problems; I'm always up for a challenge. 
    I have the most wonderful and supportive husband and son.
    After viewing my array of talents. I look forward to working with you soon.
